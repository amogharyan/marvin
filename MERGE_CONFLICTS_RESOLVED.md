# Merge Conflicts Resolution Report

**Date**: October 25, 2024  
**Branch**: `dev1`  
**Resolved By**: AI Assistant  

## Summary

Successfully resolved merge conflicts when merging `main` branch into `dev1` branch. All tests passing after resolution.

## Conflicts Resolved

### 1. `.gitignore` (both added)
**Issue**: Both branches added `.gitignore` with different content.

**Resolution**: 
- Merged both versions
- Kept `Context/` directory exclusion from HEAD (dev1)
- Kept comprehensive Node.js ignores from main
- Result: Complete `.gitignore` with both sets of rules

### 2. `ar-core/jest.config.js` (deleted by us)
**Issue**: File appeared as "deleted by us" in merge conflict.

**Resolution**:
- Kept the file (it exists in dev1 and is needed)
- Fixed configuration to only reference `tests/` directory (no `src/`)
- Removed invalid path mappings for non-existent source directories

### 3. `ar-core/package.json` (deleted by us)
**Issue**: File appeared as "deleted by us" in merge conflict.

**Resolution**:
- Kept the file (it exists in dev1 and is needed)
- File contains test dependencies and scripts

## Additional Fixes

### Missing Test Setup File
**Issue**: `ar-core/tests/setup.ts` was missing, causing test failures.

**Fix**: Created setup file with:
- Jest timeout configuration (10s)
- Console mocking to reduce test noise
- Global test setup/teardown hooks
- Proper TypeScript types for global scope

### Jest Configuration Updates
**Changes to `ar-core/jest.config.js`**:
```javascript
// Before
roots: ['<rootDir>/src', '<rootDir>/tests'],
collectCoverageFrom: ['src/**/*.ts', ...],
moduleNameMapper: { /* paths referencing src/ */ }

// After  
roots: ['<rootDir>/tests'],
collectCoverageFrom: ['tests/**/*.ts', ...],
// Removed moduleNameMapper (not needed)
```
