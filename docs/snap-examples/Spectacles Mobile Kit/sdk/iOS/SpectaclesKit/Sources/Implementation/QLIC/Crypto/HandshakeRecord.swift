/**
 Records used by the crypto handshake algorithm to set up the secure encrypted channel

 These records behave identically to the TLS handshake records, with the AuthenticationShare record being analagous to the Certificate record, and the AuthenticationVerify record being analgous to the CertificateVerify record. For reference, the handshake proceeds as follows:

 The client begins with the ClientHello.

 The server responds with the ServerHello, the AuthenticationShare, the AuthenticationVerify, and the Finished records.

 The client processes those records, and finally responds with its own AuthenticationShare, AuthenticationVerify, and Finished record. This completes the handshake.
