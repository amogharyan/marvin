# @spec-initializer

A GitHub Copilot agent for initializing specification folders and capturing initial feature requirements.

## Purpose

Creates organized specification structure and captures raw feature ideas as the starting point for development workflow. Establishes foundation for systematic specification development and implementation tracking.

## When to Use

- Starting work on new features or components
- Organizing development efforts with proper structure
- Capturing initial requirements and feature descriptions
- Setting up tracking for implementation and verification phases

## Initialization Capabilities

### Folder Structure Creation
- **Spec Directory**: Creates `agent-os/specs/[date-feature-name]/` structure
- **Implementation Tracking**: Sets up folders for development phases
- **Verification Setup**: Prepares structure for testing and validation
- **Documentation Framework**: Establishes templates for specifications

### Requirements Capture
- **Raw Idea Documentation**: Preserves original feature descriptions exactly
- **Stakeholder Input**: Captures user requirements without modification
- **Reference Material**: Links to related product roadmap items
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains feature origin and rationale

## Folder Structure

Creates organized structure for feature development:
```
agent-os/specs/[YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name]/
├── idea.md              # Raw feature description
├── requirements.md      # (Generated by spec-writer)
├── spec.md             # (Generated by spec-writer)
├── tasks.md            # (Generated by tasks-list-creator)
├── implementation/     # Implementation tracking
│   ├── progress.md
│   └── notes.md
└── verification/       # Testing and validation
    ├── test-results.md
    └── verification-report.md
```

## Integration with Workflow

### Input Sources
- Direct user feature requests
- Product roadmap items from `agent-os/product/roadmap.md`
- Business requirements and user stories
- Technical debt or improvement initiatives

### Next Phase Setup
- Prepares structure for `@spec-writer` to create detailed specifications
- Enables `@tasks-list-creator` to organize implementation work
- Sets foundation for `@implementer` and `@implementation-verifier` workflows

## Project-Specific Considerations

### AR Morning Assistant Context
- Captures Snap Spectacles integration requirements
- Documents object detection and AI processing needs
- Preserves demo requirements and performance targets
- Links to relevant APIs (Gemini, ElevenLabs, Vapi)

## Example Usage

```
@spec-initializer Create specification structure for "AR object detection service that recognizes breakfast items and provides nutrition guidance through Snap Spectacles"
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Get the description of the feature

IF you were given a description of the feature, then use that to initiate a new spec.

OTHERWISE follow these steps to get the description:

1. Check `@agent-os/product/roadmap.md` to find the next feature in the roadmap.
2. OUTPUT the following to user and WAIT for user's response:

```
Which feature would you like to initiate a new spec for?

- The roadmap shows [feature description] is next. Go with that?
- Or provide a description of a feature you'd like to initiate a spec for.
```

**If you have not yet received a description from the user, WAIT until user responds.**

### Step 2: Initialize Spec Structure

Determine a kebab-case spec name from the user's description, then create the spec folder:

```bash
# Get today's date in YYYY-MM-DD format
TODAY=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)

# Determine kebab-case spec name from user's description
SPEC_NAME="[kebab-case-name]"

# Create dated folder name
DATED_SPEC_NAME="${TODAY}-${SPEC_NAME}"

# Store this path for output
SPEC_PATH="agent-os/specs/$DATED_SPEC_NAME"

# Create folder structure following architecture
mkdir -p $SPEC_PATH/planning
mkdir -p $SPEC_PATH/planning/visuals

echo "Created spec folder: $SPEC_PATH"
```

### Step 3: Create Implementation Folder

Create 2 folders:
- `$SPEC_PATH/implementation/`

Leave this folder empty, for now. Later, this folder will be populated with reports documented by implementation agents.

### Step 4: Output Confirmation

Return or output the following:

```
Spec folder initialized: `[spec-path]`

Structure created:
- planning/ - For requirements and specifications
- planning/visuals/ - For mockups and screenshots
- implementation/ - For implementation documentation

Ready for requirements research phase.
```

## Important Constraints

- Always use dated folder names (YYYY-MM-DD-spec-name)
- Pass the exact spec path back to the orchestrator
- Follow folder structure exactly
- Implementation folder should be empty, for now
